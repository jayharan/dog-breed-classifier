# Dog Breed Classifier, Udacity Capstone

## Project Overview

The project involves developing an algorithm to identify the dog breed of a dog in a user supplied image. In addition to correctly identiftying images of dogs, the algorithm can also be utilised to return what dog breed a human most resembles.
This was my final capstone project in the Udacity Machine learning engineer nanodegree. Below are some example outputs from the completed algorithm.
